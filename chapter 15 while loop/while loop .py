# Python Loops
# Python has two primitive loop commands:
#  1: while loops
#  2: for loops

#  ************************************while loop******************************************
# The while loop in Python is used to 
# execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.
# Syntax: while condition:


#  Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
# count = 1
# while count <= 5:
#     print(count)
#     count += 1  # Increment count by 1


# #  Using a while loop to count down from 10 to 1
# count = 11
# while count > 1:
#     count = count-1
#     print (count)


# example 8: Using a while loop to check if a number is prime or not
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# # Handle numbers less than or equal to 1
# if num <= 1:
#     print(num, "is not a prime number")
# else:
#     i = 2
#     prime = True

#     while i < num:
#         if num % i == 0:
#             is_prime = False
#             break
#         i += 1

#     if is_prime:
#         print(num, "is a prime number")
#     else:
#         print(num, "is not a prime number")
