'''we are going to study if else statements 
we use the if else statement to check whatever the expression is true or false
 Basic condition statements are futher divide in following type
1: if
2: if-else
3: if-else-elif
4: nested if-else-elif'''

# ********************************************************if-else*************************************************************
# 1: AND condition
a = 6
b = 4
c = 4
# Check conditions using logical operators
if a > b and a > c:
    print("a is geater then b amd a is greater then c")
else:
    print (" a is eqal to a and b and c")

# 2: OR condition
a = 6
b = 4
c = 4
# Check conditions using logical operators
if a > b or  a < c:
    print("a is geater then b amd a is greater then c")
else:
    print (" a is eqal to a and b and c")
