#  **********************************************if********************************************
# we use the if else statement to check whatever the expression is true or false
# An "if" condition is written by using if keyword for example

#  1: Define variables
a = 5
b = 6
# Check conditions using logical operators
if b>a:
    print("b is greter than a")

#  2: AND coondition
x = 2
y = 7
z = 1
# Check conditions using logical operators
if x > z and x < y:
    print("x is greater than z and smaller than y")

#  3: OR condition
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")

# 4: NOT Condition
a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:
  print("a is NOT greater than b")
